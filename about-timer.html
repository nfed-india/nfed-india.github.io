		<p class="w3-justify about-text">Technology-Information-Management-Entrepreneurship – Review (<span class="timer">TIMER</span>) – Refereed Journal of NFED – a Unit of NFED is instituted primarily to envisage the relevance of technology and engineering and their contribution in lieu with entrepreneurship and management development with current and future trends. The core objective is to pen-in the new vistas in research domain and to promulgate the knowledge and wisdom in info-engineering and techno-management disciplines. Not with standing the efforts made in the past by the allied disciplines in sciences towards engineering, technology and management, one could figure out the inter-connectivity and networking has not been achieved in totality. Keeping this in view, the journal is aimed at stemming research aspects towards entrepreneurial management with diverse prospects of engineering &amp; technology under the ambit of excellence by integrating the inter-disciplinary research contributions in the form of empirical and / or conceptual research papers, excerpts, manuscripts, abstracts, cases and articles from researchers, scholars, academicians, practitioners, and students across the world. Today is the era of inventive innovation, which venerated and veined into technology, management and information technology in all spheres of globalization. Hence, it is a felt need of the hour and sheer necessity to resurge the internal economical cum educational avenues so as to cope with the external corporate contention cum competition embedded by global industrial cum economic arena, which keeps ever-changing with time. A novel strategic idea way of performing is through upbringing of research &amp; development potential within an academic framework for attaining sustainable development. As performance and quality deliverance can be met only through the research and development parameters which invariably acts as a recourse for continuous learning in terms of contribution across many academia viz., universities, colleges, research centers, organizations more precisely through institutes into engineering, technology and management. It also equally beckons industrial practices to reinforce, resurge, rejuvenate and renovate their platform for economical destination with educational aspiration with promising career opportunities in education as well. Not only had this depicted juxtaposition of technology, engineering and management practices through business entrepreneurship, and information technology but also caters knowledge base around the world through research &amp; development networking for institutional development to attain the knowledge sustenance and becoming an institution with virtues and values.
